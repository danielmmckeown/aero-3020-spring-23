## COURSE DESCRIPTION
AERO 3020, *Leading People and Effective Communication, Part II*, utilizes student’s field training experience to take a more in-depth look at leadership. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing communication skills, and why that is important as a leader. Students have an opportunity to try out these leadership and management techniques in a supervised environment as juniors and seniors.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course designed to build on the leadership fundamentals taught in AS200. The students will have the opportunity to utilize their skills as they begin more of a leadership role in the detachment. The goal is for students to have a more in-depth understanding of how to effectively lead people and provide them with the tools to use throughout their detachment leadership roles. Secondly, students will hone their writing and briefing skills. Many of the students will be uncomfortable with public speaking, and this semester is designed to get them used to briefing. The second semester of AS300 is centered on leadership and ethics and is mostly guided discussion. The goal here is to get students thinking about leadership through their own lens and give them some tools to work on their leadership skills.

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Attendance and Tardiness
AFROTC cadets and participating students must attend at least 80 percent of scheduled AS classes (or substitute activities determined by the respective AFROTC instructor and with approval of the Detachment Commander) to receive a passing final grade (AFROTCI 36-2011 para. 9.10.1). All planned absences or tardiness will be documented on an Official Memorandum (AFH 33-337 pg 77) and will be submitted for approval/disapproval no later than one academic day prior to class/exam. In the event of an unforeseen circumstance the day of class/exam that will result in tardiness or absence, contact me via email or phone. All absences and tardiness not prior coordinated by an Official Memorandum or a "day of" phone call will be considered unexcused.

Each unexcused absence or tardiness will result in a deduction from your total grade. Excused absences or tardiness include, but are not limited to personal illness, family hardship, illness or death, participation in AFROTC or university activities, or circumstances beyond your control. Attendance below 80 percent results in a failing grade for the class. You are responsible for contacting the instructor within three calendar days following any absence or tardiness (excused or unexcused) to submit your Official Memo, obtain missed class material, and arrange to make up missed work. Your memo should explain the circumstances surrounding your absence or tardiness. Failure to contact me and submit your memo within 3 days could result in an additional deduction to your final grade.

### 2. Customs and Courtesies/Personal Appearance:
Non-AFROTC cadets that are taking this class for credit only and are not seeking a commission will follow university dress code policies. Civilian attire should generally be conservative in nature. AFROTC cadets, however, have additional requirements. AERO 3020 is part of the formal curriculum designed to prepare cadets to be future Air Force officers.

Cadets will observe standard military customs and courtesies during class, to include:

1. Wearing the uniform directed by the current Operations Order unless an alternative is previously approved.
2. Complying with standards contained in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2903 and AFROTC Supplement to AFI 36-2903 at all times.

### 3. Academic Freedom
Disagreement and free expression of opinion are encouraged but must be professional and courteous. To promote free expression, academic freedom and non-attribution will be observed. There will be no retribution for ideas or opinions expressed in class and students may not attribute an idea or opinion to an individual outside the classroom without that person's consent. This freedom allows us the opportunity to engage in the entire spectrum of activities involved in the search of knowledge and understanding of our subject while maintaining mutual respect of others.

### 4. Food/Tobacco Use
Snacks and drinks are permitted as long as they do not become disruptive to other class members or presentation of material. All cadets are required to bring a water source to **all** PMT activities in order to maintain hydration. The use of tobacco products is prohibited.

### 5. Term Counseling and Cadet Development Feedback (AFROTC Cadets only)
#### Part I
I will counsel each ROTC cadet at least once during the semester. We will discuss your progress and review your Form 48 during this session. Term counseling sessions will be scheduled by appointment and will be completed NLT **17 Feb 2023**. Schedule appointments via [Fantastical](https://fantastical.app/danielmmckeown-X0xS/term-counseling). An electronic Form 48 will be completed and reviewed/signed by the cadet's academic and/or faculty advisor **prior to** meeting with the instructor. 

The Form 48 requirement is worth 25 points if completed **before the suspense date**. Timely completion of this task showcases that you can adhere to and complete tasks to the expected USAF standard. Five points will be deducted for each day the Form 48 is not provided after the meeting.

For your AFROTC Form 48 Appointment:  
- Wear OCPs unless the UOD states otherwise.  
- Before our appointment, meet with your Academic and/or Faculty Adviser and have them:
	-   Verify that you are on-track to graduate on-time in accordance with your ROTC agreement/contract.  
	-   Verify that you are on-track to meet any entrance to major requirements (as applicable).  
- They should sign the Form 48 once they have reviewed your academic plan.  
- You must Ensure **YOU** check graduation requirements carefully--**YOU** signed the contract with Air Force ROTC and are responsible for understanding your graduation requirements--demand clear answers from your academic and/or faculty adviser if you have questions--you (or the USAF) are paying for quality service from them and shouldn't accept a 5-minutes glance at your Form 48!  
- Sign into WINGS NLT 24 hours prior to your appointment by actually typing in your password. Review your SURF and validate your records.  
- Ensure your Form 48 is uploaded to this assignment block NLT 1 day prior to your appointment. I have to sign and review and will not do that during the meeting if you fail to upload prior.  

Participating students (not in ROTC program) may still meet with me at any time. Participating students are **EXEMPT** from this requirement and will be awarded full credit for this course requirement. 

#### Part 2
Signing and reviewing/discussing your Cadet Development Feedback is the second portion of this assignment. We can not complete this prior to Spring break - I need to take some time to give you constructive feedback. You can make your appointment for any time after Spring break. 

You must sign by the end of the term. I will discuss this with each of you during your Term Counseling/Form 48 meeting. Completion of you feedback demonstrates your ability to follow through on tasks and requirements.

### 6. Academic Integrity
When submitting work for academic credit, it is assumed the work is the students' own. Plagiarism is the act of using another person's ideas, expressions, or thoughts without acknowledging the source. If students use quotations, text, or ideas from a source other than themselves, documentation is required. For written work, documentation is given using footnotes, references, or bibliographies. If help was received from another person in the accomplishment of an assignment, that collaboration must be documented. All students, including cross-town students, will comply with the University of Massachusetts--Lowell Academic Integrity policy:

> "The integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in all aspects of its endeavor. Maintaining academic integrity is therefore the responsibility of all faculty, staff, and students at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty."

The UML Academic Integrity policy may be further explored at the following link: [http://continuinged.uml.edu/policies/academicintegrity.cfm](http://continuinged.uml.edu/policies/academicintegrity.cfm).

All work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. Additionally, cadets will abide by the Cadet Honor Code:

> "We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does."

### 7. Class Leader
A class leader will be designated each week to facilitate accountability, customs and courtesies, and assist the instructor as needed. Unless modified by the instructor, class leaders will rotate alphabetically (A-Z) through the AFROTC cadets enrolled in the class.

### 8. Inclement Weather/Safety
Safety is paramount. No student should jeopardize their safety to make it to class. For commuters, this includes speeding to avoid being late. Be aware of road conditions and inclement/winter weather the evening before class. If the roads are impassable or unsafe contact me via phone or email if you do not think you will make class or will be late. Plan ahead; bad weather will slow travel, so leave early for class if safe to do so. If you have transportation problems outside of weather delays, call me to inform me of your situation. If the instructor or university officials cancel class for safety or weather considerations, the instructor will attempt to contact each of you by phone or email as soon as possible.
