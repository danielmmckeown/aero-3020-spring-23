## COURSE TITLE
Aerospace Studies (AERO) 3020, *Leading People and Effective Communication, Part II,* (3 credit hours)
Tuesdays, 1530 - 1830 in Wannalancit Room 150

## INSTRUCTOR CONTACT INFORMATION
Major Daniel McKeown, USAF

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
AERO 3020, *Leading People and Effective Communication, Part II*, utilizes student’s field training experience to take a more in-depth look at leadership. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing communication skills, and why that is important as a leader. Students have an opportunity to try out these leadership and management techniques in a supervised environment as juniors and seniors.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course designed to build on the leadership fundamentals taught in AS200. The students will have the opportunity to utilize their skills as they begin more of a leadership role in the detachment. The goal is for students to have a more in-depth understanding of how to effectively lead people and provide them with the tools to use throughout their detachment leadership roles. Secondly, students will hone their writing and briefing skills. Many of the students will be uncomfortable with public speaking, and this semester is designed to get them used to briefing. The second semester of AS300 is centered on leadership and ethics and is mostly guided discussion. The goal here is to get students thinking about leadership through their own lens and give them some tools to work on their leadership skills.

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
### 1. Attendance and Tardiness
AFROTC cadets and participating students must attend at least 80 percent of scheduled AS classes (or substitute activities determined by the respective AFROTC instructor and with approval of the Detachment Commander) to receive a passing final grade (AFROTCI 36-2011 para. 9.10.1). All planned absences or tardiness will be documented on an Official Memorandum (AFH 33-337 pg 77) and will be submitted for approval/disapproval no later than one academic day prior to class/exam. In the event of an unforeseen circumstance the day of class/exam that will result in tardiness or absence, contact me via email or phone. All absences and tardiness not prior coordinated by an Official Memorandum or a "day of" phone call will be considered unexcused.

Each unexcused absence or tardiness will result in a deduction from your total grade. Excused absences or tardiness include, but are not limited to personal illness, family hardship, illness or death, participation in AFROTC or university activities, or circumstances beyond your control. Attendance below 80 percent results in a failing grade for the class. You are responsible for contacting the instructor within three calendar days following any absence or tardiness (excused or unexcused) to submit your Official Memo, obtain missed class material, and arrange to make up missed work. Your memo should explain the circumstances surrounding your absence or tardiness. Failure to contact me and submit your memo within 3 days could result in an additional deduction to your final grade.

### 2. Customs and Courtesies/Personal Appearance:
Non-AFROTC cadets that are taking this class for credit only and are not seeking a commission will follow university dress code policies. Civilian attire should generally be conservative in nature. AFROTC cadets, however, have additional requirements. AERO 3020 is part of the formal curriculum designed to prepare cadets to be future Air Force officers.

Cadets will observe standard military customs and courtesies during class, to include:
1. Wearing the uniform directed by the current Operations Order unless an alternative is previously approved.
2. Complying with standards contained in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2903 and AFROTC Supplement to AFI 36-2903 at all times.

### 3. Academic Freedom
Disagreement and free expression of opinion are encouraged but must be professional and courteous. To promote free expression, academic freedom and non-attribution will be observed. There will be no retribution for ideas or opinions expressed in class and students may not attribute an idea or opinion to an individual outside the classroom without that person's consent. This freedom allows us the opportunity to engage in the entire spectrum of activities involved in the search of knowledge and understanding of our subject while maintaining mutual respect of others.

### 4. Food/Tobacco Use
Snacks and drinks are permitted as long as they do not become disruptive to other class members or presentation of material. All cadets are required to bring a water source to **all** PMT activities in order to maintain hydration. The use of tobacco products is prohibited.

### 5. Term Counseling (AFROTC Cadets only)
Once per semester, cadets are required to meet individually with their instructor for mid-term counseling. This is an opportunity for us to talk one-on-one, monitor your academic progress, review your academic plan (AFROTC Form 48), and discuss any issues related to AFROTC. You must bring a copy of your AFROTC Form 48 to this meeting. The Form 48 must be reviewed and signed by your academic advisor before the end of the semester.

You will [schedule](https://fantastical.app/danielmmckeown-X0xS/term-counseling) this appointment before **15 Sep 2022**.

The suspense for term interviews is **13 Oct 2022**.

### 6. Cadet Development Feedback (AFROTC Cadets only)


### 7. Academic Integrity
When submitting work for academic credit, it is assumed the work is the students' own. Plagiarism is the act of using another person's ideas, expressions, or thoughts without acknowledging the source. If students use quotations, text, or ideas from a source other than themselves, documentation is required. For written work, documentation is given using footnotes, references, or bibliographies. If help was received from another person in the accomplishment of an assignment, that collaboration must be documented. All students, including cross-town students, will comply with the University of Massachusetts--Lowell Academic Integrity policy:
>"The integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in all aspects of its endeavor. Maintaining academic integrity is therefore the responsibility of all faculty, staff, and students at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty."

The UML Academic Integrity policy may be further explored at the following link: [http://continuinged.uml.edu/policies/academicintegrity.cfm](http://continuinged.uml.edu/policies/academicintegrity.cfm).

All work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. Additionally, cadets will abide by the Cadet Honor Code:
>"We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does."

### 8. Class Leader
A class leader will be designated each week to facilitate accountability, customs and courtesies, and assist the instructor as needed. Unless modified by the instructor, class leaders will rotate alphabetically (A-Z) through the AFROTC cadets enrolled in the class.

### 9. Inclement Weather/Safety
Safety is paramount. No student should jeopardize their safety to make it to class. For commuters, this includes speeding to avoid being late. Be aware of road conditions and inclement/winter weather the evening before class. If the roads are impassable or unsafe contact me via phone or email if you do not think you will make class or will be late. Plan ahead; bad weather will slow travel, so leave early for class if safe to do so. If you have transportation problems outside of weather delays, call me to inform me of your situation. If the instructor or university officials cancel class for safety or weather considerations, the instructor will attempt to contact each of you by phone or email as soon as possible.

## CURRICULUM
The AERO 3020 course curriculum consists of lectures, readings, classroom assignments, written assignments, computer-based training, briefings, and examinations. All AERO 3020 curriculum requirements are graded and contribute to your semester grade.

### 1. Lesson Objectives
Lesson objectives and Samples of Behavior for each lesson are listed in the Student Reader.

### 2. Reading Assignments
Reading assignments are in the Student Reader provided electronically via Blackboard. Reading assignments must be completed *before* the specified classroom lecture. Students should be prepared to discuss the Samples of Behaviors listed for each lesson.

### 3. Class Participation
Active discussion between students is essential to maximize the learning opportunities presented in this course. Students should come prepared to express their views about assigned readings and the concepts presented in class. Cadets' conduct, bearing, preparedness, and attendance are part of their class participation evaluation.

### 4. Writing Assignments
**Writing Assignment #1:** This assignment will have you reflect on leadership lessons learned and goals achieved (or not achieved) while at field training and will be a one to two-page Official Memorandum written IAW Chapter 14 of AFH 33-337, *The Tongue and Quill*, and written on Air Force letterhead. All students will upload their memos as a PDF with the following naming convention: `Memo - Field Training Lessons Learned - LASTNAME` to Blackboard no later than 2359 on **29 Sep 22**. This assignment will be worth **50 points**.

**Writing Assignment #2:** The purpose of this assignment is to write a background paper that provide information on the same topic that is presented during the informative briefing. The background paper must be on the same topic and follow the same general format as the briefing. The background paper provides information on a topic. The background paper needs to be written in accordance with AFH 33-337 The Tongue and Quill and the guidance included in Attachment #1. The completed background paper will be due on **24 Nov 2022.** This assignment will be worth **100 points**.

### 5. Informational Briefing
Students will deliver an informative briefing to inform the audience on a Combatant Command (COCOM) or air and space system. The intent is not to give a current events briefing, or advocate for support of a weapons system, but solely to inform the audience on the area in general or about the chosen system. It deals only with facts; it has no place for recommendations. Students will deliver a 5-9 minute briefing using the standard military briefing format: introduction, body, and conclusion. This assignment will be worth **100 points**.

### 6. Exams/quizzes
There will be two exams, and each is worth 100 points. Content for all exams will come from the lectures, films, and reading assignments. Testable items are normally taken from the Samples of Behavior contained in your Student Reader. Questions may consist of matching, multiple choice, short answer/fill in the blank, and short essay. See the attached course sequence for dates. Exams will be administered via Blackboard and are considered "open note" but **not** "open Wingman".

## ATTACHMENT #1 INFORMATIVE BRIEFING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. General Briefing Information
#### a. Briefing Type
This is an informative briefing. An informative briefing promotes understanding, enlightenment, and education about a topic.

#### b. Briefing Purpose
Students will deliver an informative briefing to inform the audience on a Combatant Command (COCOM) or air and space system. The intent is not to give a current events briefing, or advocate for support of a weapons system, but solely to inform the audience on the area in general or about the chosen system. It deals only with facts; it has no place for recommendations.

#### c. Briefing Style
The informative briefing will be done in a prepared briefing style. According to AFH 33-337, _The Tongue and Quill_, a prepared briefing is a briefing that is not scripted or memorized, but carefully planned, outlined, and practiced prior to the delivery. The specific words and phrases used in the delivery are spontaneous and natural. This is also known as an extemporaneous briefing. 

#### d. Briefing Topic
Each student will select a COCOM region or air and space system to brief. The topic selection process is at the discretion of the evaluating officer. Students within a class will coordinate to ensure that no two briefings are given on the same topic in the same class. 

The list of topics is as follows (lists are also found in the student reader):

#### e. Individual Work
_This is an individual assignment. All students must do their own academic work. Class_ members may give each other feedback when preparing for the briefing delivery, but each briefing is an individual effort. There will be no “student protection society” when the briefings are delivered. For example, students will not signal to their classmate when they have reached the time limit. All notes will be put away prior to the first briefing. Once the briefings begin, breaks will be at the evaluating officer’s discretion.

#### f. Grading
Evaluating officers will grade students on the Holm Center Form 6, _Briefing Evaluation Sheet._  The grade form outlines specific grading criteria—students should review the grading form prior to the briefing to gain familiarity with specific grading criteria. The headers of the grade sheets will be filled out by all students and turned in to the evaluating officer. Refer to the program’s syllabus for grading weight.

#### g. Delivery
Students will stand in front of the audience and deliver the briefing. Students should not deliver briefing from behind lectern. Students may use the lecture to hold notes.

#### h. Background Paper
A background paper will accompany this briefing. The background paper should match the briefing. See the background paper portion of this lesson plan for specifics on this. 

### 2. Mandatory Briefing Requirements
An “Unsatisfactory” rating in _any_ of the following areas will result in an automatic failure of the briefing.

#### a. Time Required
The briefing length required is 5–9 minutes. A final briefing time outside of the 5–9 minutes will result in an automatic unsatisfactory rating on the briefing.

#### b. Met Objective
This is an informative briefing; it must inform the audience on the topic. It will not advocate for a position, a course of action, or US involvement in country or region.

#### c. Organization
The briefing must follow the prescribed three-main point format. The main point format is discussed in detail further in this lesson plan and in the student reader.

#### d. Prepared Briefing
The briefing must be in a prepared briefing format. It will not be read like a manuscript briefing or memorized.

#### e. Professional Conduct
The briefer must be prepared, use appropriate comments and language, and maintain composure throughout. If the briefer stumbles, the briefer should maintain military bearing and press on to complete the briefing. No profanity, unprofessional language, or derogatory comments should be used.

### 3. Briefing Organization
There will be an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. The introduction should tell the audience what you are going to tell them. The body should tell the audience the supporting points for the overall main point. The conclusion should restate what was briefed.

#### a. Introduction/Overview
i. Greet Audience
		The student must address the evaluating officer individually with the greeting of the day, followed by a greeting of the day given to the rest of the audience.
		For example, “Good morning, Capt Smith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.” OR “Good morning, ma’am. Good morning flight xx-xx.”

ii. Introduce Self

The student will then introduce him/herself with the following verbiage: “I am Rank Last Name.” “My name is Rank Last Name” should be avoided because a person’s rank is not their name. An example of a full introduction with correct verbiage is as follows: “Good morning, ma’am (or Capt Smith). Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am:

(OTS) OT Jones or (ROTC) Cadet Jones.”

iii. Introduce Topic and Main Points

After the students gives proper greeting of the day and introduces him/herself, the student must state the topic and the three main points. The student should expand on the three main points and give a brief overview of what will be briefed. Laundry listing the main points will not earn the student full points according to the grading form—the briefing must expand on the main points and provide some information about the main points.

#### b. Body
Informative Brief:
- Main Point One: The first main point will discuss the mission and characteristics of the COCOM or air and space system.
- Main Point Three: The third main point will discuss one of the following:
- Main Point Two: The second main point will discuss the role that the COCOM or system has played in past or current Air and Space Forces missions.
- How the system or COCOM supports US Foreign Policy
- What role the system or COCOM will play in future conflicts
- The system’s role or the COCOM’s role in Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
- A historically significant event involving that system or country

_It is imperative in this briefing, however, that there is no advocacy for a topic._  The third main point should solely discuss the purpose of the system in our current inventory, not why we should go to war with this system, for example.

i. Main Point Organization
- Each main point should support the overall briefing topic.
- Each main point should relate to each other. The organization overall should help to aid in the audience’s understanding. For greatest audience comprehension, for this briefing, main points one and two should lay the foundation for the third main point. This is shown in the below example.
- The time spent on each main point should be adequate to explain the main point to the depth required. Although there is no set requirement that each main point should be discussed for the exact same amount of time, there should be balance between the main points. One main point should not be discussed for only 30 seconds when each other main point is explained for 3 minutes. Ensure that the amount of depth that each point is discussed is equal, too. One main point should not be explained in detail when the other main points are only explained at a surface level. Each main point should be explained at a level—not too shallow but not too detailed—that is appropriate for the topic and for the time allotted.

ii. Body Example

Example:

If the US interest in the country is oil, the cultural domains chosen for main points one and two lay the foundation for that discussion:

Main Point 1: Mission and Characteristics of System
- Multi-Mission (Electronic Attack, Air-to-Surface, Air-to-Air
- Unparalleled Stealth, Helmet Mounted Display, Distributed Aperture System, Vertical Take-off

Main Point 2: Systems Role in Past or Current Mission
- Air Superiority 
- Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)

Main Point 3: _Choose One:_

- How the system supports US Foreign Policy
- What role the system will play in future conflicts
- The system role in Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
- ·A historically significant event involving the system

iii. Transitions: The purpose of transitions is to link and relate one piece of content to the next piece of content. Transitions are required between each main point. For maximum points possible, creative transitions must be used between the main points. To receive partial credit, mechanical transitions can be used.
- Mechanical Transition Example: “We just talked about Roman Catholicism in Italy, and now we will discuss the role of family,” or, “Next, we will discuss the role of the family in Italy.”
- Creative Transition Example: “Italy’s roots in Roman Catholicism directly impact the way that Italians view the role of family and familial relations.”

#### c. Summary/Conclusion
i. Restate Topic and Main Points

The student must restate the main topic and briefly expand on all main points. No new information should be introduced; the conclusion should simply be a restatement of what was discussed with a brief expanded summary of the main points. The conclusion should not be a complete re-explanation or re-brief of the main points.

ii. State Conclusion Verbiage

The student will end the briefing with the following statement for full credit: “This concludes my briefing. Are there any questions?”

e. Example Summary Slide

This is an example slide to provide students with a sample of what a final summary slide looks like. Point out to the students that the only difference between the overview slide at the beginning and the summary slide at the end is the slide title.

### 4. References
#### a. Purpose
The purpose of completing research for this briefing is to demonstrate the ability to research and adequately support main points.

#### b. Resources

i. List of Research Sites: There is a list of research sites at the end of the informative briefing requirements student reader. These websites provide credible information on possible briefing topic.

ii. University or College Library: Abundance of great resources for research.

iii. Other Credible Websites: Students are authorized to visit other websites for information on their briefings. All sources must be credible.

#### c. Number of Sources Required
At least 3 different sources are required for the informative briefing. Each of the sources must be credible, or it will not count towards the total number of sources. _Wikipedia does not count as a reference. Sources in foreign languages are not authorized._

#### d. Citing Work
All information that is not original to the author must be from a source and cited. If work is not cited, it is considered plagiarism and is a breach of academic integrity.

e. Notes and End Notes: All work will be cited using notes and end notes. All notes and end notes are to be in accordance with _The Tongue and Quill._  _The Tongue and Quill_ mirrors the Chicago Style Manual, which can also be used as a reference for formatting notes and end notes. Specifically, page 138 and Appendix A: Note Citations of _The Tongue and Quill_ provide information on how to format notes and end note citations.

i. PowerPoint Slideshow: In-Text Note Citations

All sources will be referenced in the body of the slides using superscript numbers as in-text notes. Wherever information from that source is referenced, there must be a note citation.

In-Text Note Examples:
- Population: Approx. 62 million people.<sup>1</sup>
- CIA World Fact book: Italy is gateway for illegal drugs to Europe.<sup>1</sup>
- US and Italy are NATO allies.<sup>2</sup>

ii.  In PowerPoint Slideshow: Final Slide: End Notes

All sources will be listed as end notes on the final slide of the PowerPoint presentation. The numbering of the end notes needs to match the reference numbers at the top of the grading form.

End Note Examples:
1. Central Intelligence Agency, “Italy,” World Fact book, accessed 11 August 2015, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html.
2. US Department of State, “US Relations with Italy,” 15 April 2015, http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4033.htm.

iii. Verbal References: 
When delivering the briefing, three or more resources must be verbally referenced. When verbally referencing, state the author or organization who wrote, compiled, etc. the source, as applicable, _and_ the title of the article, webpage, book, etc. the information was sourced from.

Verbal Reference Examples:
- “According to the CIA’s (organization) World Fact book on Italy (web page)…”
- “Secretary of State John Kerry (author/speaker), in his address to Congress on 3 Mar 14 (title of speech), stated…”

### 5. Visual Aids
#### a. PowerPoint Required
Students must use PowerPoint slides as a visual aid. At a minimum, there will be one slide for the overview, one slide for each main point, and one slide for the summary. Depending on the topic, an effective presentation may require more.

#### b. Graphics and Images
Graphics or images are required in the slide presentation. All graphics or images used must be professional and related to the topic of the briefing. All graphics or images used must enhance the presentation.

#### c. Background Style and Font Color
Background and font color combination should enable easy reading from the furthest corners of the presentation area. Generally, it is very difficult to use a picture as a background due to the variations in color, although it can be done effectively if the right font and font color are chosen and overlaid on the picture. A good rule of thumb for all slide presentations is to check the readability of the slides from the furthest spot in the presentation area. If the slides are not readable from that spot, alterations should be made. There is no required slide template, but the slides should be consistent and look professional.

#### d. Font
A readable, professional font and font size should be used. A few acceptable fonts to use are Times New Roman or Arial, among others. Do not use the fonts Curlz, Comic Sans, script fonts, or any fonts of the like. Font size should be big enough that it can be read from the furthest corners of the presentation area. If there is a lot of additional white space on the slide, it is usually a good idea to bump the font size up.

#### e. Information on Slides
Information should be bulleted. Bullets should be concise. Do not use full sentences or paragraphs of information. The intent of the slides is to aid in the presentation and cue the briefer on the information that should be briefed; do not include every bit of information on the point on the slide. The only time it is acceptable to put a full sentence or paragraph on a slide is when a direct quote is required from a source. There should be some white space on the slide—the entire slide should not be jam-packed with information.

#### f. Grammar
Correct use of grammar in the slide presentation is a representation of the speaker’s professionalism. A few grammar errors can detract greatly from an otherwise flawless briefing. Double-check all grammar and run a spell check before the presentation.

#### g. Consistency
Ensure that there is consistency throughout the slide presentation. The slide colors and style should be consistent throughout. The font, font size, and font colors should be consistent throughout (i.e., bulleted information is the same size on each line on the slide). The bulleting style should be consistent throughout (i.e., do not use square bullets on one slide and dashes on the next). Inconsistencies in the slide presentation should only exist to enhance a point. Inconsistencies in the slide presentation can detract from the professionalism of the briefing and the credibility of the speaker.

## ATTACHMENT #2 BACKGROUND PAPER REQUIREMENTS
### 1. General Paper Information
#### a. Paper Type
This is a background paper. The background paper provides information on a topic. The background paper needs to be written in accordance with AFH 33-337 _The Tongue and Quill_ and the guidance included in this lesson plan.

#### b. Paper Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide background information on the same topic that is presented during the informative briefing delivery. **_The background paper must be on the same topic and follow the same general format as the briefing._**

#### c. Individual Work
The paper is to be completed individually. The writing and the formatting are considered graded measurements. Therefore, both must be done individually.

#### d. Grading
Evaluating officers will grade the papers using the Holm Center Form 9, _Paper Evaluation Sheet_. Students should look at a copy of the grading form prior to submitting the paper to better understand the expectations and grading requirements. Refer to the program’s syllabus for grading weight.

#### e. Paper Length
Two pages is the suggested length of the background paper. However, the paper length is at the discretion of the program or detachment (ROTC typically 1/2 to 1 page bullet style). Regardless of the parameters put on the paper length, the end notes at the end of the paper do not count towards the final page count.

### 2. Mandatory Paper Requirements
An “Unsatisfactory” rating in _any_ of the following areas will result in an automatic failure of the briefing.

#### a. Original Work
Any work that is not original to the author must be cited. If work is not cited, it is considered plagiarism. Any sentence that utilizes quotation marks and does NOT include a reference is considered plagiarism.

#### b. Met Objective
Paper informs and provides background information to the reader. As in the briefing, it is imperative that the paper does not advocate for a position or course of action. This paper is solely an informative paper providing background on a particular country or region. Paper was turned in on time.

#### c. Professional Conduct
The paper must be composed professionally. The content must be respectfully communicated. For example, profanity is prohibited.

### 3. Paper Organization
The paper will follow the same general format as the briefing; there will be an introduction, body, and conclusion.

#### a. Introduction
The first paragraph of the paper will be the introduction paragraph. It will state the topic and the main points. It may discuss sub points as well. The topic and main points must be the same as the topic and main points discussed in the briefing.

#### b. Body
The body will follow the same format as the briefing. The first two main points will discuss one cultural domain each. The third main point will discuss US interests in the country or region. Each main point must support the overall topic. _See the briefing portion of this lesson plan for detailed information on the main point format._

- Body Formatting: The formatting of the body paragraphs is at the discretion of the writer. Each main point does not need to be its own numbered paragraph; each main point can be a sub paragraph (i.e., a, b, c paragraph) of one “body” paragraph. _See the formatting portion of this lesson plan for more information on this._

#### c. Conclusion
The final paragraph of the background paper will be a conclusion paragraph. The conclusion paragraph will state the main topic and restate the main points. There should be no new information introduced in this paragraph. Due to the informative nature of this background paper, no position or recommendations should be given.

### 4. Paper Format
AFH 33-337, _The Tongue and Quill_, is extremely critical in Air and Space Forces writing. This document should be the baseline document for formatting all Air and Space Forces writing.

#### a. File Name
The paper will be submitted to evaluating officer with the correct file naming convention.

- Example: AERO 3020 Fall - Background Paper – MCKEOWN

#### b. Margins
The paper will have one-inch margins on all sides: top, bottom, left, and right.

#### c. Font
All text will be Times New Roman 12 pt. This includes the title, identification line, end notes, page numbers, etc.

#### d. Page 1 Identification Line
An identification line will be placed 1” from the bottom or ½” in the footer on the first page only. The ID line will be formatted per the example in AFH 33-337, _The Tongue and Quill_: “Rank/Title, Last Name/OTS Program or ROTC Office Symbol (Flight Job)/Telephone (Full DSN or 10-Digit Commercial)/Typist’s initials/DD MMM YR”

- ROTC Example: Cadet McKeown/Det 345/OFC/978-934-2252/dmm/29 Sep 22

#### e. Page 2
Page numbering begins on the second page and continues sequentially thereafter one-half (1/2) inch from the top of the page and flush with the right margin.

#### f. Format Example
i. Margins: There are one-inch margins on all sides. The title begins one inch from the edge of the top of the page.

ii. Title: The title is three lines. All three lines are written in all capital letters. The first line must read “BACKGROUND PAPER.” The second line reads “ON.”  The third line communicates the subject of the paper: “SUBJECT,” (i.e., ITALY). 

iii. Line Spacing and Wrapping: The title is double-spaced. Single-space within paragraphs and double-space between paragraphs; wrap all paragraphs to align with the left margin.

### 5. Writing Mechanics
#### a. Spacing
The Air Force Handbook (AFH) 33-337, _The Tongue and Quill_, provides the criteria for spacing. The spacing rules are as follows: There will be two spaces after a number. For example, at the beginning of a numbered paragraph, there will be two spaces after that number. There will be two spaces after the end of a sentence. The dots indicate spaces in the following example:

Example:
- The OTS campus is located at Maxwell AFB. The base is located in Montgomery, Alabama. Montgomery is the capital of Alabama.

Spacing criteria when using a period is as follows:
- No space _before_ an ellipsis. 
- One space _after_ an abbreviation with a period within a sentence.
- No space _after_ a decimal point or _before_ within two numbers.
- No space _after_ when another punctuation mark immediately follows (closing quotation mark, closing parenthesis, comma following an “abbreviation” period).
- Two spaces _after_ a number or letter that indicates an enumeration (rule 5b).
- _The Tongue and Quill_ favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

#### b. In-Text Numbers
Generally speaking, numbers that are greater than 10 should be written numerically. Numbers one through nine should be written out. _Exceptions:_  Numbers that begin a sentence should be written out. Figures can be used, regardless of the number, when writing clock time, measurements/dimensions, latitude/longitude, military units, and dates (i.e., 0950, 8½ by 11 inches, 32°25’20”, 9th Mission Support Group/9 MSG/3 AF, 5 June 2014). _See Tongue and Quill for detailed specific exceptions._

#### c. Third Person
The background paper should be written in third person. Unless used in a direct quotation, the words “I,” “you,” “us,” “we,” etc. should not be used in the paper.

#### d. Abbreviations and Acronyms
Abbreviations and acronyms will be used IAW the _The Tongue and Quill_. Abbreviations and acronyms must be written out the first time they are used followed by the abbreviation/acronym in parenthesis. Only the abbreviation/acronym will be used thereafter. This is demonstrated in the following example:
- Example: Air Combat Command (ACC) is headquartered at Joint Base Langley-Eustis. ACC was created on 1 Jun 92.

#### e. Spelling
Spelling must be correct throughout document.

#### f. Grammar
Grammar must be correct throughout document. For example, subject-verb agreement, meaning, pluralization, capitalization, etc. should be correct throughout the document.

#### g. Punctuation
Punctuation not addressed on other parts of form must be correct. For example, the use of quotation marks, commas, semi-colons, ellipses, etc. is correct through the document.

#### h. Sentence Structure and Word Choice
Sentences must be well-constructed. Sentences should be structured in a way that reads in an educated and informed way. The writer should take into consideration the audience who will be reading the paper and write accordingly. Effective, professional words should be utilized. For example, there should be no use of words such as “stuff,” “things,” etc. In all, the sentence structure and word choice should add to the credibility of the writer and the content of the paper. 

### 6. References
#### a. Number Required
At least three different, credible, and relevant sources are required. The same criteria for credible and relevant apply for the informative briefing and background paper. It is acceptable to use the same references for both the briefing and background paper. _Wikipedia is not considered credible. Sources written in a foreign language are not authorized._

#### b. In-Text Note Citations
Superscript numbers will be used to cite sources in the body of the paper. The notes must begin with a number one and follow sequentially thereafter. The numbers used throughout for in-text citations will correspond with the numbers used in the end notes. In-text note citations must be placed at the end of a sentence or the end of a clause, following any punctuation mark or closing parenthesis. Note citation will not be used following a dash. All notes must be formatted in accordance with the _The Tongue and Quill_, specifically, page 138 and Appendix A: Note Citations. These rules are followed in the following examples:
- Examples:
	- The population of Italy is approximately 62 million people.<sup>1</sup>
	- Italy is a gateway for illegal drugs to Europe.<sup>1</sup>
	- The US and Italy are NATO allies.<sup>2</sup>
	- Russia agreed to stop sales to Brazil—a longtime practice<sup>3</sup>—at the urging of the State Department.

#### c. End Notes
The end notes will not count towards the overall page count. In general, the same end notes can be used were used in the briefing slides. All end notes must be formatted in accordance with the _The Tongue and Quill_, specifically, page 138 and Appendix A: Note Citations.
- Examples: 
1. Central Intelligence Agency, “Italy,” World Fact book, accessed 11 August 2015, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html.
2. US Department of State, “US Relations with Italy,” 15 April 2015, http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4033.htm.
